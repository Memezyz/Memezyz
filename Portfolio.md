# Background

Heyo, I am MemezyDev, or Memezy! I am a 15 year old programmer who lives in California (Timezone PST). I have been developing on the ROBLOX platform for almost 4 years at this point, however I have started to take it seriously (actually trying to learn, not screwing around, doing commissions) for 2 years at this point. My first few commissions were making GFX, and later I switched over to what I currently do, scripting. Over the years, I have coded a wide number of games, Ranging from Cafe and Hotel games, to Roleplay and Tycoon games.

# Skillset

I speciallize in Luau, the language of Roblox. I have many hours of expirience on the platform, with many systems under my belt. I have created many, many systems and games for a wide range of players who needed them. As said in the background tab, I have created games such as Simulators, Tycoons, Cafe/Hotel games, and Military based games. I mainly specialize in short-term tasks, as that's what I get asked for the most. I usually code systems for people, such as an egg hatching system, building system, admin panels, you name it! With my skillset, I can bring your ideas to life :D

# Strengths and Weaknesses

I am no where close to being an extremely talented scripter, as I am still learning. I can complete many tasks with ease, however some topics I may struggle with depending on what you are asking for, and the difficulty. Some things that I know for a fact I will struggle with is camera manipuiation (things like freemove cameras, cutscenes), and FPS guns. 

# Past Examples

Now, I know what you're thinking

"Show us the examples already!"

Below are a few examples that I have worked on over the years. Some are old and some are recent, so take them with a grain of salt. With every commission, I strive to produce better and better end products with every job I take on.

(Egg hatching system that allows you to hatch pets, equip them, and having a working inventory system. Most is not done as the commissioner cancelled mid-project)

(Arresting system. Only works with two players. It allows for arresting players, booking in jail, and breaking out of said jail.)

If you don't have someone else to test it with you, here is a short video I made demonstrating what it does.

(Sword fighting system. I started this but got lazy and never finished it. Q to equip the Katana, and left click to attack. Animations not made by me, I found them in a free model)

(Flashbang throwing system, you press E and you can flashbang other players, or yourself)

# Availability

I am usually always on my computer. I don't like coding 24/7 as I'll just end up getting burnt out and taking months off coding which will make me rusty, it has happen before. I try to code at least for 2-3 hours a day minimum, working on any commissions I have. The queue for commissions is pretty much like a first come first serve system. I work on the first jobs I get, then once that one is done I move on to the next. If you hire me for a long term commission, sometimes I will work on somethinh small, then move to a short term job I have. On the weekdays, since it is currently summer, I pretty much got the entire day to get online and start coding, and on weekends I may be busy here and there but usually I am still on the same amount of time. When school starts, my schedule will be changed a little bit, and I may not be on all day like I currently am, but still will be on to code for at least 2 hours a day.

# Pricing

If you are coming here from a server such as Hidden Developers or RoDevs, then you may have seen my pricing sheet. This is what I try to base all my commissions on, so you will want to resort to that to check my prices as I may update that in the future and forget to update it here. I only accept payments vis PayPal, and in USD currency. I will accept forign currencies, however you are responsible for any of the conversion fees that appear. I don't accept Robux/Percentages, as percentages are risky and for Robux I don't play Roblox so I see no point in it. 

# Contact

And we've reached the end of my Portfolio. Thanks for sticking around. I am extremely active on Discord, you can reach out to me by sending me a friend request 

### Memezy#6113

Sometimes I may accept random friend requests, but sometimes I won't since my DMS got bombed in the past. A good way to contact me is by joining Hidden Developers, as then I can look at our mutual servers and see that this is related to a roblox commissions

Anyways this is all I got for my portfolio. Thank you for sticking around, and I hope shortly in the future we can work together :)
